# Email Authentication

LeadVirt supports passwordless email authentication alongside Telegram and provider-delivered password recovery for credential accounts.

## Flow

- `GET /api/auth/email-otp/config` reports availability and resend timing.
- `POST /api/auth/email-otp/request` creates a 6-digit, 10-minute challenge and sends it through the configured provider.
- `POST /api/auth/email-otp/verify` consumes the challenge once, creates or resolves the workspace, and sets the normal HTTP-only session cookie.
- New verified emails create a trial workspace; existing emails open their first active workspace.

Codes are HMAC-hashed with `AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_PEPPER`, limited to five verification attempts, invalidated after use, and never logged. Requests have per-IP/email limits plus a database-backed 60-second resend lock.

Production requires `AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_ENABLED=true`; provider credentials alone do not enable the feature.

## Beget SMTP

Beget SMTP is the active production path while the new domain is not eligible for UniSender sender verification.

```dotenv
AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_ENABLED=true
AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_PEPPER=<at-least-32-random-characters>
EMAIL_OTP_PROVIDER=smtp
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
EMAIL_FROM=LeadVirt.ai <noreply@leadvirt.com>
SMTP_HOST=smtp.beget.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=noreply@leadvirt.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=<mailbox-password>
SMTP_FROM_NAME=LeadVirt.ai
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@leadvirt.com
```

Store the mailbox password only in `/opt/leadvirt/secrets/.env`. Port `465` uses TLS from connection start. Run a transport authentication check and a real inbox OTP smoke before exposing the email option.

## UniSender

The classic UniSender `sendEmail` API remains supported as a later fallback. It requires a verified sender email and a contact-list ID.

```dotenv
AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_ENABLED=true
AUTH_EMAIL_OTP_PEPPER=<at-least-32-random-characters>
EMAIL_OTP_PROVIDER=unisender
EMAIL_PROVIDER=unisender
EMAIL_FROM=LeadVirt.ai <noreply@leadvirt.com>
UNISENDER_API_KEY=<rotated-key>
UNISENDER_LIST_ID=<authentication-list-id>
UNISENDER_SENDER_NAME=LeadVirt.ai
UNISENDER_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@leadvirt.com
```

`EMAIL_OTP_PROVIDER` is separate from `EMAIL_PROVIDER`. Both support `smtp`, `unisender`, and non-production `mock`; production password reset rejects `mock`, `manual`, unsupported providers, and incomplete provider configuration before creating a usable token.

## Password Reset

- `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` requires credential auth to be enabled and a ready SMTP or UniSender provider in production.
- Reset tokens are stored only as hashes and staged as unusable while delivery is pending.
- Provider acceptance can activate the token only while the captured password hash is still current. Activation, confirmation, and authenticated password changes share one PostgreSQL lock, so an in-flight delivery cannot activate after a completed password change.
- Delivery failure returns the same generic response as an unknown account and leaves the staged token invalid. Delivery is still synchronous, so request duration can differ; durable queued delivery remains required to remove that timing oracle.
- The request audit is attempted after activation. Audit failure is logged without URL/provider details and does not invalidate an already delivered link.
- Production responses and logs never contain the reset URL. Non-production `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock` retains the reset URL response and log for local QA.
- Requests are limited to one per normalized recipient per minute and eight per hour, with an additional per-IP limit.
- `POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm` consumes the token once, changes the password, and revokes active sessions.

In production, `APP_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must resolve to the same public HTTPS origin. Credentials, paths, queries, hashes, localhost, and mismatched hosts are rejected before token creation.

Before enabling production:

1. Update `/opt/leadvirt/secrets/.env` and restart the API service.
2. Verify SMTP authentication without sending a message.
3. Run a real inbox delivery smoke.
4. Confirm one-time code consumption and `/api/auth/me` returns `authMode: "email"`.

UniSender enforces at least 60 seconds between emails to one recipient. The classic API also adds recipients to the configured list; move to UniSender Go if authentication volume or transactional-delivery requirements outgrow this API.
