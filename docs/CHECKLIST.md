# LeadVirt Checklist

Last updated: 2026-07-07

## Next

No open Umnico onboarding tasks.

## Done

- [x] Fixed GitHub Actions pnpm cache bootstrap by installing pnpm before `actions/setup-node` resolves the pnpm store path.
- [x] Re-verified the cleanup/deploy optimization suite and deployed release `20260707114255-cleanup-staging` to staging VPS; `https://leadvirt.ru/health` returned `200` and no-cookie `/api/auth/me` returned `401`.
- [x] Cleaned archived UI/reference material from the repo, disabled the old `qa:visual` design-only comparison, added `qa:ui:smoke`, trimmed web dependencies, optimized deploy packaging/Docker cache inputs, and verified web/api/worker checks plus Docker build.
- [x] Added Telegram login account switching: API exposes public bot id, `/login` can reset Telegram OAuth session before choosing another account, and regular Telegram callbacks remain accepted.
- [x] Added Umnico onboarding to Integrations UI: client-entered token save through `PATCH /integrations/WEBHOOK_API/settings`, redacted `apiTokenStatus`, Umnico webhook URL with query secret, and no-SQL test lead buttons covered by `integrations-api.spec.ts`.
- [x] Added Umnico inbound compatibility through the existing Webhook/API public channel: `message.incoming` normalization, query-string `secret` support for providers without custom headers, ignored handling for non-inbound Umnico events, provisioning output for `UMNICO_WEBHOOK_URL`, and passing local `qa:umnico:webhook`.
- [x] Deployed Umnico inbound support to `leadvirt.ru`, passed live `qa:umnico:webhook` against `lvwh_8ebd05e2661fc484`, cleaned the disposable smoke lead/conversation/event, and registered Umnico webhook id `31397`.
- [x] Repointed Umnico webhook id `31397` to Artur Kamalov workspace through dedicated channel `lvwh_de926322af19b128`, passed live `qa:umnico:webhook`, and cleaned the disposable smoke record.
- [x] Fixed Umnico real Instagram payload parsing so inbound text is read from `message.message.text`, sender login becomes the customer name, and source resolves to `Umnico Instagram` instead of the fallback `Umnico message`.
- [x] Added Umnico outbound delivery for Inbox/AI replies through `POST /v1.3/messaging/<lead-id>/send`, queued manual Inbox messages into `channels.sendMessage`, and added `qa:umnico:outbound`.
- [x] Wired `WEBHOOK_API` integration settings to configure Umnico channel delivery credentials safely: API token is stored on the channel, integration settings return only `apiTokenStatus`, and `qa:umnico:settings` verifies no token leak.
- [x] Rewrote demo conversation copy so inbox threads follow coherent sales flows: intent, qualification, price/slot, confirmation, and next action.
- [x] Added a demo-only live conversation replay in `/demo/inbox/:conversationId`: client/AI messages appear with typing indicators, replay can be skipped or repeated, manual actions pause the script, and no API/DB boundary remains enforced.
- [x] Reworked `/demo` into an interactive no-API product demo across dashboard, inbox, leads, automations, analytics, audit, integrations, billing/settings, onboarding, and widget; local browser state resets on reload, and focused demo-boundary/browser smoke passed.
- [x] Started AI runtime Phase 1 with tenant-scoped business knowledge sources, `/api/knowledge/sources`, onboarding-to-knowledge sync, extended onboarding business fields, and focused API smoke coverage.
- [x] Implemented AI runtime Phase 2 foundation: Qdrant compose services, tenant knowledge chunks, deterministic local embeddings, reindex/search API, Qdrant-backed indexing, DB fallback search, and focused onboarding-to-RAG smoke coverage.
- [x] Started AI runtime Phase 3 with a queued LangGraph.js `ai.reply` worker path, named graph nodes, RAG context metadata, quality gate fallback, audit/usage logging, idempotent duplicate handling, and `qa:ai:graph` smoke coverage.
- [x] Added Phase 3 zod-validated AI tool schemas and tenant-scoped execution for lead update, lead note creation, status change, draft booking proposal, and handoff task creation; `qa:ai:graph` now verifies tool results, booking draft, note, status change, and duplicate idempotency.
- [x] Added Phase 3 worker reliability foundation with processor timeout wrapper, final-attempt DLQ audit capture, `worker:dlq:inspect`, and `qa:worker:dlq` timeout/failure smoke coverage.
- [x] Moved public Widget, Webhook/API, and Telegram AI reply intake to `ai.reply` queue mode when `AI_REPLY_MODE=queue`; added `qa:ai:queue-routing` route-level smoke for public endpoint queue publishing.
- [x] Added Phase 3 `channels.sendMessage` delivery worker for queued Webhook/API and Telegram AI messages with tenant/channel checks, adapter send, `QUEUED -> SENT/FAILED` status transitions, audit logging, and `qa:channels:delivery` smoke coverage.
- [x] Added `qa:ai:public-loop` smoke for the main clean-account scenario: session-backed clean tenant, onboarding knowledge, RAG reindex/search, public Webhook/API lead, queued LangGraph reply, `channels.sendMessage` delivery, booking draft, inbox, and dashboard verification.
- [x] Started Phase 4 LLMOps with `artifacts/evals/ai-golden-set.json` and `qa:ai:quality`, covering grounded pricing, booking draft, human handoff, and missing-grounding quality gate behavior with pass-rate/score/retrieval thresholds.
- [x] Added `qa:ai:quality` to the LeadVirt.ru GitHub Actions verify job with a Postgres service and migration step, and included `artifacts/evals` in deploy packages.
- [x] Expanded `qa:ai:quality` pilot-niche coverage to beauty, auto detailing, education/course booking, and clinic handoff cases; current deterministic golden set passes 7/7.
- [x] Added optional `qa:ai:real-eval` for real-provider golden-set runs with an LLM judge; it skips unless `AI_EVAL_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=true` is set.
- [x] Added RAGAS-style retrieval metrics and persisted eval reports: `qa:ai:quality` now writes `artifacts/reports/ai-quality-gate-report.json`, `qa:ai:real-eval` writes a real/skip report, and GitHub Actions uploads AI eval reports as artifacts.
- [x] Started Phase 5 observability with a lightweight Prometheus metrics foundation: API `/metrics`, API HTTP request counters/latency, worker `/metrics`, worker job/DLQ counters, AI graph duration/status, and outbound channel delivery outcomes.
- [x] Added Phase 5 per-tenant AI token budget guard with `AI_TENANT_DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET`, `AI_TENANT_MONTHLY_TOKEN_BUDGET`, pre-call blocking, `BUDGET_BLOCKED` usage logs, and `qa:ai:budget` coverage.
- [x] Added optional Prometheus/Grafana observability profile with local/staging scrape configs and a provisioned `LeadVirt AI Runtime` dashboard.
- [x] Added opt-in OpenTelemetry tracing foundation with OTLP HTTP exporter support and manual spans for API requests, queue publishing, worker jobs, LangGraph graph/nodes, and channel delivery.
- [x] Added Tempo to the optional observability profile and provisioned it as a Grafana trace datasource for OTLP HTTP traces.
- [x] Added richer AI runtime cost/quality panels and metrics: quality-gate outcome counters, budget-block counters, blocked-token counters, and dashboard panels for quality reasons plus budget blocks/tokens.
- [x] Started Phase 6 security hardening with `qa:ai:isolation` and `qa:ai:qdrant-isolation`, covering DB fallback and Qdrant tenant-filtered RAG isolation.
- [x] Added a shared PII/secret redaction helper for observability/runtime payloads, redacted HTTP log route actions, OpenTelemetry error messages/stacks, and AI graph tool-call metadata stored in message metadata, usage logs, lead events, and audit logs.
- [x] Added reusable API `@Roles`/`RolesGuard` RBAC enforcement and restricted knowledge source create/update/archive/reindex endpoints to OWNER, ADMIN, and MANAGER; `qa:rbac:knowledge` verifies VIEWER/AGENT denial and read access.
- [x] Extended Phase 6 RBAC/ABAC to channel create/update endpoints and AI tool execution: channel mutations require OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER, tool calls verify tenant conversation ownership, lead-conversation consistency, and same-tenant assignees.
- [x] Extended the Phase 6 product RBAC matrix to billing, integrations, and workflows: billing plan/payment mutations require OWNER/ADMIN; integration actions and workflow mutations/tests require OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER; `qa:rbac:product-matrix` verifies the matrix.
- [x] Added Phase 6 AI audit surface: tenant-scoped `/api/ai-audit`, `qa:ai:audit` redaction/isolation smoke, and `/app/audit` UI for usage logs, quality gates, tool calls, retrieved context, and AI-related audit events.
- [x] Added `qa:ai:audit-ui` Playwright coverage for `/app/audit`, verifying API-backed audit events, payload redaction, and forbidden-role error state.
- [x] Added Phase 6 PII tagging for observability payloads and prompt/eval artifact redaction: `redactAndTagSensitiveData`, sanitized quality/real-eval reports, sanitized real-provider judge payloads, and `qa:ai:eval-redaction`.
- [x] Fixed `RolesGuard` runtime injection so RBAC-protected endpoints use Nest `Reflector` correctly instead of returning 500; re-verified `qa:rbac:knowledge` and `qa:rbac:product-matrix`.
- [x] Added and passed `qa:ai:acceptance`: clean Telegram-auth workspace, onboarding knowledge/catalog/availability, Webhook/API intake, queued LangGraph reply, grounded price/slot answer, RAG evidence, tool calls, delivery, usage, audit, worker metrics, dashboard, inbox, lead detail, and activity timeline.
- [x] Added `qa:ai:acceptance` to the LeadVirt.ru GitHub Actions verify job with Redis, API/worker startup, worker build checks, deterministic Telegram auth token, queue mode, and DB fallback RAG.
- [x] Added `deploy/run-ai-acceptance.sh` and switched the staging env example to `AI_REPLY_MODE=queue` so post-deploy staging acceptance validates the real queued AI path inside Docker Compose.
- [x] Stabilized root TS smoke scripts by using `pnpm exec tsx` without the Windows-breaking extra `--`; re-verified `qa:ai:acceptance`, `qa:ai:quality`, and `qa:pii:redaction`.
- [x] Made draft booking tool planning deterministic for explicit booking requests with an available slot, so staging real-provider acceptance does not depend on the recommendation model choosing `create_booking_draft`.
- [x] Pushed and deployed the AI runtime branch to `leadvirt.ru`; GitHub Actions run `28768725262` passed verify, deploy, and required `qa:ai:acceptance`, then staging `deploy/run-ai-acceptance.sh` passed inside the worker container against the live Docker stack.
- [x] Kept public URL preflight as operator-local QA instead of installing Playwright browsers into deployment images; `release:public-ready` can run non-browser gates with `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_READY_SKIP_PUBLIC_PREFLIGHT=1` and marks the report accordingly.
- [x] Confirmed `leadvirt.ru` public auth is Telegram-only with `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED=false`; credential-operator 2FA is deferred until password/staff login is intentionally re-enabled.
- [x] Restarted the local Master Budet backend on `localhost:4002` with the live LeadVirt bridge env, updated its side-by-side ports to `API_PORT=4002` and `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002`, verified `/health`, and passed the focused `leadvirt-bridge.service.spec.ts`.
- [x] Verified Master Budet uses a real live LeadVirt Webhook/API channel (`lvwh_...`) instead of `demo-generic-webhook`; `qa:pilot:public` passed 3/3 against `https://leadvirt.ru` for Webhook/API, then the disposable `Pilot Webhook Public ...` lead/conversation were removed from staging.
- [x] Regenerated `docs/PILOT_PACKET.md` for `https://leadvirt.ru` and the real `lvwh_...` endpoint; live webhook secrets are redacted by default unless `LEADVIRT_PILOT_PACKET_INCLUDE_SECRETS=1` is explicitly set.
- [x] Updated the deploy workflow artifact upload action to `actions/upload-artifact@v7` to clear the Node 20 runtime deprecation warning.
- [x] Added `qa:release-readiness` to guard pilot packet secret redaction and skipped public-preflight report mode.
- [x] Added `qa:release-readiness` to the LeadVirt.ru GitHub Actions verify job.
- [x] Added and verified `qa:meta:instagram`: Meta Page `LeadVirt.ai`, connected IG `@leadvirt.ai`, granted messaging permissions, Page token, and Instagram conversations query pass without logging secrets.
- [x] Added `META_REQUIRE_INSTAGRAM_CONVERSATION=1` mode for `qa:meta:instagram` so real Instagram DM smoke fails unless at least one conversation is visible.
- [x] Documented the AI runtime implementation plan in `docs/AI_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and recorded the LangGraph/Qdrant production-runtime decision in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
- [x] Fixed Landing initial-load stutter while preserving animations: landing now renders mostly as server HTML, product providers moved off the root layout, expensive blur/image work was reduced, Niches motion loads on scroll, and focused performance/scroll Playwright smokes were added.
- [x] Optimized only the Landing first-screen hero appearance by moving hero entrance/visual animation frames from Framer Motion to CSS keyframes while preserving the animated cards, central node, and gradient SVG flow line; verified with web typecheck/lint/build and Playwright screenshots on `localhost:3001`.
- [x] Fixed the Landing hero SVG flow-line first-load micro-freeze by starting the dash animation inside its cycle and verified locally that the freeze is gone.
- [x] Created a local root `.env` for LeadVirt `localhost:3001`/`localhost:4001` development and scrubbed `AI_API_KEY` from `.env.example`.
- [x] Added shared root `.env` loading for API, worker, AI smoke, and public-release readiness scripts without overriding already-provided process environment variables.
- [x] Made OpenAI `AI_REASONING_EFFORT` and `AI_VERBOSITY` runtime-configurable through `@leadvirt/config` and the shared `OpenAiProvider`.
- [x] Fixed `qa:ai:provider` to run through an API package script and use a clean ASCII smoke prompt.
- [x] Added the `AI_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER` safety gate so local `AI_PROVIDER=openai` config stays on mock AI until real provider calls are explicitly enabled.
- [x] Verified env-aware AI configuration with `@leadvirt/config`, `@leadvirt/ai`, `@leadvirt/api`, and `@leadvirt/worker` typecheck/lint/build; with the current local `.env`, `qa:ai:provider` passes on mock AI with one warning because `AI_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=false`.
- [x] Fixed clean-workspace Integrations so copied design defaults no longer count disconnected providers as connected before tenant API data loads.
- [x] Fixed clean-workspace Analytics so no response samples return `0` average/p90 seconds, no fake scenario run counts, and no static AI insights.
- [x] Added focused empty-state Playwright coverage for Integrations connected counts and Analytics response-time KPI.
- [x] Verified the clean Integrations/Analytics fixes with API/Web typecheck, lint, build, focused Playwright `integrations-api` + `analytics-api` specs, and a restarted web dev server on `localhost:3001`.
- [x] Stabilized the clean-user data-separation smoke for cold Next dev route loads by using route content readiness instead of `networkidle` and giving the multi-route audit enough time to complete.
- [x] Ran the full regression QA after clean-user verification: `qa:api` passed 43/43 and `qa:visual` passed 32/32 against LeadVirt `localhost:3001`/`localhost:4001` and design reference `localhost:5173`.
- [x] Ran `release:public-ready` dry run after real OpenAI smoke; it fails closed at environment validation and writes `docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_READY_REPORT.md` with AI configured and public/provision env still missing.
- [x] Generated a dedicated local ED25519 SSH key for `leadvirt-staging-01` and documented the public key/fingerprint in `docs/SERVER_SETUP.md`.
- [x] Added `artifacts/scripts/server-post-install.sh` for Ubuntu 24.04 server bootstrap with deploy user, SSH hardening, UFW, fail2ban, unattended upgrades, Docker Engine, swap, and LeadVirt directories.
- [x] Bootstrapped the new VPS `193.187.92.88` as `leadvirt-staging-01`; verified `deploy` SSH, Docker/Compose, UFW, fail2ban, unattended upgrades, swap, and LeadVirt directories.
- [x] Added the staging Docker deployment kit: root `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, nginx reverse proxy, `deploy/docker-compose.staging.yml`, and `deploy/env.staging.example`.
- [x] Deployed LeadVirt to `/opt/leadvirt/current` on `193.187.92.88` with Docker Compose, Postgres, Redis, API, worker, web, and nginx on public HTTP port 80.
- [x] Created the clean staging operator account `staging-admin@leadvirt.ai`; credentials are stored server-side in `/opt/leadvirt/secrets/operator-login.txt`.
- [x] Verified staging health, landing, `/demo`, no-cookie API `401`, `/app` unauth client redirect to `/login`, clean workspace zero metrics/lists, and strict auth readiness for `staging-admin@leadvirt.ai`.
- [x] Bootstrapped the FR AI gateway VPS `147.90.14.240` as `fr-vmnano`, deployed the AI gateway on `https://147-90-14-240.sslip.io:8443/v1`, and restricted OpenAI proxy access to the main staging server IP.
- [x] Switched staging `AI_BASE_URL` to the FR AI gateway and verified real OpenAI `qa:ai:provider` passes from the staging API container with `gpt-5.5`.
- [x] Reran staging public-release checks after the AI gateway change: AI smoke, strict auth readiness, Webhook/API provisioning, and pilot packet generation passed; public URL preflight passed locally 3/3 because the runtime API container does not include a Playwright browser.
- [x] Removed disposable public-preflight `Pilot ...` records from the staging operator tenant after verification.
- [x] Chose the production domain split: `leadvirt.ru` for the current Russian-market release and `leadvirt.ai` for the later English/global version.
- [x] Replaced Caddy with nginx in deploy configs and on the running main staging server.
- [x] Replaced the FR AI gateway runtime with nginx, issued a certbot certificate for `147-90-14-240.sslip.io`, kept `xray` on port `443`, and re-verified real OpenAI smoke through the gateway.
- [x] Prepared `leadvirt.ru` HTTPS cutover kit: nginx HTTPS template, certbot webroot, port `443` mapping, cutover script, and cert renewal script on staging.
- [x] Enabled production HTTPS on `https://leadvirt.ru` and `https://www.leadvirt.ru`, switched staging/public env to `https://leadvirt.ru`, installed cert renewal, and verified health, redirects, auth readiness, AI smoke, and public URL preflight.
- [x] Updated local Master Budet backend bridge env to send order intake to the live LeadVirt Webhook/API channel at `https://leadvirt.ru`.
- [x] Verified the Master Budet LeadVirt bridge contract with focused Jest, backend typecheck, a real `https://leadvirt.ru` webhook smoke, and cleanup of the disposable smoke records.
- [x] Added RU auth identifier policy: signup/login accept Russian email domains or Russian `+7` phone numbers, reject non-RU mailbox domains, and keep `leadvirt.ai` as a staff exception.
- [x] Added `User.phone`, the additive `user_phone` migration, phone-aware auth payloads, and phone display in the product shell.
- [x] Documented `AUTH_IDENTIFIER_POLICY`, `AUTH_STAFF_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, and `AUTH_EXTRA_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` in `.env.example`.
- [x] Updated auth UI copy to "Почта или телефон", removed prefilled auth/reset emails, and refreshed auth QA defaults to Russian test addresses.
- [x] Added and verified `qa:auth:identifier-policy` for RU email/phone acceptance and non-RU email rejection.
- [x] Switched RU public auth to Telegram-only registration/login with `POST /auth/telegram`, signed payload verification, clean first-workspace creation, and `authMode: "telegram"`.
- [x] Replaced login/signup UI with Telegram auth only and redirected public password reset pages back to `/login`; credential auth remains a local/staff fallback behind `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED`.
- [x] Added `TELEGRAM_LOGIN_BOT_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_BOT`, and `qa:auth:telegram` coverage for invalid signatures, first login, repeat login, and Telegram auth mode.
- [x] Verified Telegram auth with API/Web typecheck, lint, build, `qa:auth:telegram`, focused Playwright `auth-flow`, and desktop/mobile screenshots.
- [x] Deployed Telegram auth to `https://leadvirt.ru` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_BOT=LeadVirtAi_bot`, server-side Telegram login token, `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED=false`, rebuilt containers, and verified health, no-cookie `401`, password-login disablement, password-reset redirect, and production `qa:auth:telegram`.
- [x] Verified BotFather `/setdomain` for `@LeadVirtAi_bot`: `https://leadvirt.ru/login` now renders the real Telegram login button instead of `Bot domain invalid`.
- [x] Re-ran production Telegram auth smoke inside the API container after BotFather setup; signature verification, first workspace creation, repeat login, and cleanup passed.
- [x] Replaced the visible nested Telegram button with a real Telegram iframe underneath and a LeadVirt green visual mask above it using `pointer-events: none`; verified web typecheck/lint/build, production deploy, health, no-cookie `401`, final `https://leadvirt.ru/login` screenshot, and click-through popup opening to Telegram OAuth.
- [x] Added GitHub Actions auto-deploy for `leadvirt.ru`: verify shared types/API/Web, upload a release over SSH, switch `/opt/leadvirt/current`, rebuild Docker Compose, and verify health plus no-cookie `401`.
- [x] Generated a dedicated `leadvirt-github-actions` ED25519 key, installed its public key for `deploy@193.187.92.88`, and verified SSH/Docker access with that key.
- [x] Installed GitHub CLI locally, added `LEADVIRT_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` to `artur-kamalov/LeaedVIrtAi`, fixed the deploy package path, and verified GitHub Actions run `28728555134` deploys `leadvirt.ru` successfully.
- [x] Updated the deploy workflow to current GitHub Actions runtime majors (`actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v6`) and verified run `28728749943` deploys successfully without the Node 20 deprecation warning.
- [x] Enforced the demo/real-data boundary: `/app/**` now requires a real user session and renders only tenant DB data, while `/demo` is a static read-only preview.
- [x] Removed anonymous demo fallback from tenant-scoped API/UI paths; missing sessions return `401` or redirect to `/login` instead of loading demo tenant data.
- [x] Added `qa:demo-boundary` and Playwright clean-user separation coverage; verified full `qa:api` passes 38/38 with credentials-only app access.
- [x] Removed remaining Settings/Profile fake defaults, copied demo team members, fake API keys, and hardcoded Analytics recommendation numbers from real product pages.
- [x] Updated visual smoke to authenticate protected app routes as a clean user and verified `qa:visual` passes 32/32.
- [x] Re-verified the demo/real-data cleanup with `@leadvirt/web` typecheck, lint, production build, `qa:demo-boundary`, focused clean-user/settings specs, full `qa:visual` 32/32, and full `qa:api` 38/38.
- [x] Removed the unused copied `design/product/data.ts` fixture file and added a guardrail that fails if demo fixtures return to the real product design area.
- [x] Renamed the backend credentials-only guard from `DemoAuthGuard` to `WorkspaceAuthGuard` and re-verified protected API routes with full `qa:api` 38/38.
- [x] Fixed `@leadvirt/api start` to use the actual compiled entry and verified API start on `localhost:4001` with `/health` and `/health/ready`.
- [x] Audited `apps/web/src/legacy-functional` in `docs/LEGACY_FUNCTIONAL_AUDIT.md` and confirmed active app code does not import legacy UI or `features/mock`.
- [x] Extended `qa:demo-boundary` to fail if active app code imports `legacy-functional` or `features/mock`.
- [x] Removed the implicit `demo-website-widget` fallback from production widget frame/embed paths; `/widget/demo` remains the explicit demo surface.
- [x] Added widget coverage that verifies embed/frame require an explicit public key and re-verified full `qa:api` 39/39.
- [x] Renamed integration sample payloads/actions from demo-looking values to explicit `sample` values and extended `qa:demo-boundary` to catch regressions in integration samples.
- [x] Added Settings Security TOTP 2FA setup, QR rendering, enable/disable actions, hashed recovery codes, 2FA-aware login, and encrypted TOTP secret storage.
- [x] Added and applied the additive `user_two_factor` DB migration locally, plus `AUTH_2FA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env.example`.
- [x] Verified 2FA hardening with DB validate/generate/migrate, DB/API/Web typechecks, API/Web lint/build, focused Settings Playwright smoke, full `qa:api` 39/39, and a live API 2FA smoke.
- [x] Added self-service password reset request/confirm flow with hashed reset tokens, local/mock reset URL delivery, session revocation, and `/forgot-password` plus `/reset-password` UI.
- [x] Added and applied the additive `password_reset_tokens` DB migration locally.
- [x] Verified password reset with DB validate/generate/migrate, DB/API/Web typechecks, API/Web lint/build, focused Auth Playwright smoke, and a live API reset smoke.
- [x] Added in-memory auth rate limiting for login, signup, password-reset request, and password-reset confirm endpoints, with `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED` as a local escape hatch.
- [x] Added `qa:auth:rate-limit` and verified repeated password reset requests return `429`.
- [x] Added and locally verified `qa:auth:staging-ready` to validate auth migrations, seed credential ownership, no-cookie API guard behavior, and staging/public auth env posture before external release.
- [x] Decided Webhook/API via the Master Budet order bridge as the first real acquisition channel for external release.
- [x] Added `POST /channels` provisioning for Website, Telegram, and Webhook/API channels with generated non-demo public keys.
- [x] Added Settings > Channels Webhook/API setup details so operators can copy endpoint, public key, secret header, and secret for the Master Budet bridge.
- [x] Added and locally verified `qa:channels:provisioning` for creating a real Webhook/API channel on a temporary workspace and accepting public intake through it.
- [x] Added `provision:webhook-channel` to create/reuse a target workspace Webhook/API channel and print Master Budet bridge env values without persisting secrets by default.
- [x] Added `release:public-ready` to orchestrate strict auth readiness, Webhook/API provisioning, pilot packet generation, and public URL preflight for staging/public release.
- [x] Updated `qa:pilot:public` to support `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS`, so the first real release can validate only `webhook` instead of requiring Telegram and Widget.
- [x] Verified `qa:pilot:public` with local public env and `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS=webhook`, then removed the disposable pilot record with confirm-gated cleanup.
- [x] Added a non-production QA header bypass for auth login rate limiting so repeated Playwright clean-user logins stay stable while production and explicit rate-limit tests remain protected.
- [x] Re-verified the release smoke after auth/channel hardening with full `qa:api` passing 41/41, `qa:auth:rate-limit`, and `qa:auth:staging-ready` on `localhost:3001`/`localhost:4001`.
- [x] Verified `release:public-ready` fails closed without public/staging env and writes a redacted `docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_READY_REPORT.md` listing the missing variables.
- [x] Added a real OpenAI AI provider behind `AI_PROVIDER=openai` using the Responses API with structured JSON outputs, while keeping `AI_PROVIDER=mock` as the local QA default.
- [x] Switched API sync paths and worker queue processing to the shared AI provider token so Conversation, Widget, Telegram, Webhook/API, and queued AI replies use the configured provider.
- [x] Updated `release:public-ready` to block public/staging release unless `AI_PROVIDER=openai` and `AI_API_KEY` are set, with AI secrets redacted in the readiness report.
- [x] Added `qa:ai:provider` to validate AI reply, extraction, recommendation, summary, and intent provider contracts locally with mock AI and on staging with real OpenAI.
- [x] Included `qa:ai:provider` in `release:public-ready` after env validation so invalid OpenAI keys/models fail before channel provisioning.
- [x] Verified the OpenAI provider abstraction with `@leadvirt/ai` lint/typecheck/build, `@leadvirt/config` lint/typecheck/build, `@leadvirt/api` lint/typecheck/build, `@leadvirt/worker` lint/typecheck/build, `qa:ai:provider`, `qa:channels:provisioning`, and full `qa:api` 41/41.
- [x] Copied UI/UX source from `LeadVirt-React-design-only` into `apps/web/src/design`.
- [x] Copied design styles and adapted them into `apps/web/src/styles`.
- [x] Kept `apps/web` as a Next 15 app instead of running Vite inside web.
- [x] Added Next route wrappers for landing, onboarding, app dashboard, inbox, conversation, leads, automations, analytics, integrations, settings, pricing, features, solutions, and demo.
- [x] Adapted copied `NavProvider` to map design routes to Next routes.
- [x] Added design dependencies required by copied components.
- [x] Extended Tailwind scanning and tokens for copied design components.
- [x] Archived old web UI areas under `apps/web/src/legacy-functional`.
- [x] Fixed copied UI compatibility issues found during migration:
  - [x] Windows `Button.tsx` / `button.tsx` case collision.
  - [x] shadcn button adapter for design variants and sizes.
  - [x] integrations disconnect handler.
  - [x] automation `AnimatePresence` fragment warning.
  - [x] local grain/noise style instead of broken external noise asset.
  - [x] mobile conversation header layout overlap.
  - [x] Next ESLint plugin detection warning.
- [x] Verified `@leadvirt/web` with typecheck, lint, and production build.
- [x] Added Playwright visual and interaction smoke spec at `artifacts/playwright/visual-check.spec.ts`.
- [x] Verified main desktop and mobile routes with fresh screenshots.
- [x] Verified desktop sidebar navigation and mobile bottom navigation route mapping.
- [x] Changed product sidebar and mobile bottom navigation from route buttons to real Next links while preserving copied visual styling.
- [x] Stabilized visual route-change assertions for cold Next dev compilation.
- [x] Verified visual smoke against web `localhost:3001` and design-only reference `localhost:5173`: 32/32 checks passed.
- [x] Verified `@leadvirt/web` production build after the product navigation link change and restarted Next dev on `localhost:3001`.

- [x] Verified post-port-migration release checks with `@leadvirt/web` lint/build and `@leadvirt/api` lint/build, then restarted Next dev on `localhost:3001`.
- [x] Verified full local `pilot:ready` on `localhost:3001`/`localhost:4001`, including real seeded public intake smoke.
- [x] Removed disposable pilot records with `db:cleanup:pilot -- --confirm`; follow-up dry-run reports 0 leads, 0 conversations, 0 workflows, 0 workflow runs, and 0 webhook events.
- [x] Regenerated `docs/PILOT_PACKET.md` and `docs/PILOT_READY_REPORT.md` after cleanup with `LEADVIRT_READY_SKIP_LOCAL_INTAKE=1`; local doctor passed and cleanup counts remain zero.

## Active / Next

- [x] Push/deploy the current AI runtime branch, confirm GitHub Actions `qa:ai:acceptance` passes, then run `qa:ai:acceptance` once inside staging with the real Telegram login token and intended AI provider settings before inviting external testers.
- [x] Resolved OpenAI access from staging via the FR AI gateway; direct staging host egress was blocked by `403 unsupported_country_region_territory`, but gateway egress returns valid OpenAI responses.
- [x] Verified real OpenAI provider smoke with `AI_PROVIDER=openai`, `AI_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=true`, `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-5.5`, `AI_REASONING_EFFORT=low`, and `AI_VERBOSITY=low`; `qa:ai:provider` passed all reply, extraction, recommendation, summary, and intent contract checks.
- [x] Enable 2FA for `staging-admin@leadvirt.ai` before broad external access, or confirm it is not applicable while `leadvirt.ru` remains Telegram-only with password login disabled.
- [x] Decide whether `release:public-ready` should install/use Playwright browsers in the deployment image or keep public URL preflight as an operator-local QA step.
- [x] Defer `leadvirt.ai` routing/localization until the English/global release track starts.
- [x] Restart/redeploy the Master Budet backend with the updated LeadVirt bridge env before inviting external testers.
- [x] Provision a real staging Webhook/API channel, copy its generated public key/secret into the Master Budet bridge env, and avoid `demo-generic-webhook` for external traffic.
- [x] Run `qa:pilot:public` against the first actual tunnel/staging URL before inviting external testers.
- [x] Regenerate `docs/PILOT_PACKET.md` after the first public tunnel/staging URL is configured, without committing live webhook secrets.
- [ ] Add focused tests for functional behavior once API-backed features return.

## Notes

- Current priority is visual fidelity and route correctness.
- The copied UI is intentionally static/demo-first until functionality is layered back in.
- `localhost:3001` should be restarted after `next build` before UI QA, because a running dev server can serve stale chunk references after `.next` changes.
- If Next dev reports missing vendor chunks after a production build, stop the dev server, delete `apps/web/.next`, and restart `next dev`; this is a build-cache reset, not a source change.
- `qa:ui:smoke` is the current focused UI smoke and does not require a design-only reference server.
- Stop `next dev` before `next build` if Next reports missing page modules during page-data collection; this can happen when dev and build write `.next` at the same time.
- Prisma CLI validation requires `DATABASE_URL` in the shell environment; the API runtime still has its local default through `AppConfigService`.
- API, worker, `qa:ai:provider`, and `release:public-ready` load the nearest root `.env` locally before reading AI/provider settings; deployment-provided environment variables still take precedence. `AI_PROVIDER=openai` uses mock AI until `AI_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=true`.
- `qa:ai:real-eval` is budget-gated: it exits as skipped unless `AI_EVAL_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=true`, `AI_PROVIDER=openai`, `AI_ENABLE_REAL_PROVIDER=true`, and `AI_API_KEY` are present. Use `AI_EVAL_CASE_IDS` and `AI_EVAL_MAX_CASES` to control cost.
- AI eval reports are generated under `artifacts/reports/` and ignored by git; the LeadVirt.ru verify workflow uploads them as `ai-eval-report`.
- Settings Security is API-backed for password changes, session revocation, and TOTP 2FA setup/disable/recovery-code flows.
- Billing plan selection, cancellation, manual payment-method change requests, and invoice downloads are API-backed for manual MVP subscriptions; hosted checkout/payment-provider enforcement remains follow-up billing work.
- `qa:auth:guard` is a real local API/DB smoke; run it with LeadVirt API available on `localhost:4001` or set `LEADVIRT_API_BASE`.
- Shared API-to-design mapping for product CRM surfaces belongs in `apps/web/src/design/product/apiAdapters.ts`.
- 2026-07-07: Channel delivery worker now preserves top-level `deliveryJobId` in message metadata for queued AI replies; verified with `qa:ai:acceptance`.
