# First Social Test Client Pilot Runbook

Last updated: 2026-06-27

This runbook is for the first controlled pilot clients coming from social traffic. The goal is to prove the manager-facing product loop, not final production operations.

## Pilot Scope

Ready to test:

- Landing/demo routing and credential client-cabinet login flow.
- Credential sessions, TOTP 2FA setup/login, self-service password reset, temporary-password enforcement, and auth rate limiting.
- Dashboard, Inbox, Conversation, Pipeline, Automation, Analytics, Settings, Widget, and demo Billing UI.
- Telegram webhook demo intake.
- Generic webhook/API demo intake for social-adjacent sources and form/zap-style traffic.
- Website widget intake.
- Automation runtime MVP for active workflows on inbound widget, webhook, and Telegram messages.
- Manager actions: send messages, AI draft, handoff/status, CRM/task/booking actions, lead stage updates, transcript export, analytics CSV export.

Out of scope for this pilot:

- Production SSO/OAuth and enterprise identity-provider flows.
- Real Billing/checkout.
- Real OAuth or production social-account connection flows.
- Auto deployment and production infrastructure.
- Full external CRM/calendar sync beyond existing API stubs/actions.

## Local Preflight

1. Start infrastructure and seed demo data:

```bash
docker compose up -d
corepack pnpm db:migrate
corepack pnpm db:seed
```

2. Start the app:

```bash
corepack pnpm dev
```

3. Confirm the local URLs:

- Web: `http://localhost:3001`
- API health: `http://localhost:4001/health`
- API routes: `http://localhost:4001/api`
- Widget demo: `http://localhost:3001/widget/demo`

4. Run the combined readiness check before inviting a pilot client:

```bash
corepack pnpm run pilot:ready
corepack pnpm run qa:ai:provider
corepack pnpm run qa:auth:staging-ready
corepack pnpm run qa:channels:provisioning
corepack pnpm run provision:webhook-channel
corepack pnpm run release:public-ready
```

`pilot:ready` regenerates the packet, runs the fast doctor, runs the local real-intake smoke, skips public preflight unless public URL env vars are set, and prints a cleanup dry-run count.
It also writes the latest shareable readiness report to `docs/PILOT_READY_REPORT.md`.
`qa:ai:provider` validates the configured AI provider contract. Local runs use `AI_PROVIDER=mock`; staging/public runs should set `AI_PROVIDER=openai` and `AI_API_KEY`.
`qa:auth:staging-ready` validates the configured database and auth boundary. Local runs may warn about dev env values; for a staging/public release gate set `LEADVIRT_AUTH_READY_STRICT=1` with the target `DATABASE_URL`, public `APP_URL`, and non-mock email/rate-limit settings.
`qa:channels:provisioning` validates the first real-channel path by creating a temporary Webhook/API channel with a generated non-demo key and posting public intake through it.
`provision:webhook-channel` logs into the target workspace, creates or reuses the Webhook/API channel, and prints the exact Master Budet env values. On non-local APIs it refuses demo public keys.
`release:public-ready` is the public/staging one-command gate: strict auth readiness, real OpenAI provider env, Webhook/API provisioning, packet regeneration, and public URL preflight.

For public/staging release, set real AI env before running the gate:

```bash
$env:AI_PROVIDER="openai"
$env:AI_API_KEY="..."
$env:AI_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
```

Local QA can continue using `AI_PROVIDER=mock`.

For debugging individual pieces, run:

```bash
corepack pnpm run pilot:doctor
corepack pnpm --filter @leadvirt/web typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @leadvirt/web lint
corepack pnpm --filter @leadvirt/web build
corepack pnpm run qa:api
corepack pnpm run qa:ai:provider
corepack pnpm run qa:auth:staging-ready
corepack pnpm run qa:channels:provisioning
corepack pnpm run provision:webhook-channel
corepack pnpm run qa:pilot:intake
```

After `next build`, restart `next dev` before browser QA. If localhost serves stale chunks, stop the web dev server, delete `apps/web/.next`, and restart `corepack pnpm dev:web`.

5. Generate the operator packet for the current local/public URL setup:

```bash
corepack pnpm run pilot:packet
```

The packet is written to `docs/PILOT_PACKET.md` and includes operator links, public keys, intake endpoints, headers, sample payloads, QA commands, and cleanup commands.
It also includes copy/paste PowerShell smoke commands for Telegram, Webhook/API, and Widget intake with unique pilot ids.

## Public URL / Tunnel Preflight

Use this when exposing the local pilot through a public tunnel or staging URL. The check is skipped unless both public base URLs are set.

Required:

```bash
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE="https://your-public-web-url"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="https://your-public-api-url/api"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS="webhook"
corepack pnpm run qa:pilot:public
```

Optional overrides if the seeded demo keys are not used:

```bash
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_KEY="..."
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_SECRET="..."
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_KEY="..."
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WIDGET_KEY="..."
```

The preflight verifies:

- Public web routes `/`, `/demo`, and `/widget/demo` load.
- Public API health is reachable.
- Widget config is reachable when `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS` includes `widget`.
- Selected public intake endpoints accept traffic and create a conversation/lead response. Without `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS`, the preflight checks `telegram,webhook,widget`; for the first Master Budet release use `webhook`.

If you run the preflight against local URLs, use:

```bash
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE="http://localhost:3001"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="http://localhost:4001/api"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS="webhook"
corepack pnpm run qa:pilot:public
```

For the full public release gate, set the target DB/auth/provisioning env and run:

```bash
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
$env:APP_URL="https://your-public-web-url"
$env:NODE_ENV="production"
$env:APP_ENV="staging"
$env:AUTH_2FA_ENCRYPTION_KEY="..."
$env:EMAIL_PROVIDER="..."
$env:AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED="false"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE="https://your-public-web-url"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="https://your-public-api-url/api"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_CHANNELS="webhook"
$env:LEADVIRT_PROVISION_EMAIL="owner@example.com"
$env:LEADVIRT_PROVISION_PASSWORD="..."
corepack pnpm run release:public-ready
```

After setting public URL env vars, regenerate the packet so it prints the public tester-facing links:

```bash
corepack pnpm run pilot:packet
```

## Traffic Entry Points

For the first external release, use Webhook/API as the first real acquisition channel. Instagram and WhatsApp are deferred until their provider permissions/review paths are ready.

For staging/public Master Budet traffic:

- Configure the target API and credential env, then run the provisioning helper:

```bash
$env:LEADVIRT_API_BASE="https://your-public-api-url/api"
$env:LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="https://your-public-api-url/api"
$env:LEADVIRT_PROVISION_EMAIL="owner@example.com"
$env:LEADVIRT_PROVISION_PASSWORD="..."
$env:LEADVIRT_PROVISION_2FA_CODE="123456" # only if 2FA is enabled
corepack pnpm run provision:webhook-channel
```

- Alternatively, sign in to the staging LeadVirt workspace and open Settings > Channels to enable/create `Webhook/API`.
- Use the generated non-demo public key, which starts with `lvwh_`.
- Use the generated webhook secret from channel settings as `LEADVIRT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- Set Master Budet `LEADVIRT_WEBHOOK_URL` to `{publicApiBase}/public/channels/webhook/{publicKey}/events`.
- Do not use `demo-generic-webhook` for external tester traffic.

Operator-facing endpoint details are also visible in `/app/integrations`:

- The top `Готовность входящих каналов` panel shows whether Telegram, Webhook/API, and the website widget currently have active public keys/endpoints for pilot traffic.
- Use the `Тестовый лид` buttons in that panel to send Telegram or Webhook/API sample intake directly from the setup screen.
- Use `Открыть виджет` in that panel to open the local widget demo before showing it to a pilot client.
- Open a connected `Telegram` or `Webhook/API` card.
- Click `Настроить`.
- Use the `Публичный входящий endpoint` panel to copy the endpoint URL, public key, secret header name, or sample payload.

Telegram demo webhook:

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:4001/api/public/channels/telegram/demo-telegram-webhook/webhook`
- Header: `x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token: demo-telegram-secret`

Generic webhook/API demo:

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:4001/api/public/channels/webhook/demo-generic-webhook/events`
- Header: `x-leadvirt-webhook-secret: demo-webhook-secret`

Master Budet order-created bridge:

- Master project: `C:\Users\camal\.apps\master_ryadom`
- Bridge code: `backend/src/leadvirt`
- Keep LeadVirt web/API on `http://localhost:3001` and `http://localhost:4001`.
- Run Master Budet on non-conflicting ports, for example web `http://localhost:3002` and backend `API_PORT=4002`.
- Point Master Budet frontend to that backend with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4002`.
- In Master Budet backend env set:
  - `LEADVIRT_AI_ADMIN_ENABLED=true`
  - `LEADVIRT_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/public/channels/webhook/demo-generic-webhook/events`
  - `LEADVIRT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=demo-webhook-secret`
- Submit a real Master Budet `/order/new` request and verify the lead appears in LeadVirt `/app/inbox` and `/app/leads`.

Website widget:

- Demo page: `http://localhost:3001/widget/demo`
- Public key: `demo-website-widget`
- Embed snippet:

```html
<script async src="http://localhost:3001/widget/embed.js" data-leadvirt-key="demo-website-widget"></script>
```

## Pilot Script

1. Open `/demo` with the client to show the product without implying account access.
2. Use `/login` for the client cabinet flow. In the seeded local workspace, use `admin@leadvirt.ai` / `demo-demo`.
3. Send one inbound message through a selected entry point.
4. Verify the lead appears in `/app/inbox` with the correct client name, channel, source, and latest message.
5. Open the conversation and verify message history, timeline, AI draft, handoff/status actions, and transcript export.
6. Check `/app/leads` and verify the lead is in the correct pipeline column with the same source/channel context.
7. Move the lead one stage forward and create a manager task.
8. Check `/app/automations` and confirm active workflow status, test-run behavior, and no unsaved changes before relying on a scenario.
9. Check `/app/analytics` after a few messages to confirm visible activity and export a CSV if needed.

## What To Watch

- Does the source label stay clear enough for a manager to understand where the lead came from?
- Does the social lead remain easy to find after navigation, refresh, and stage changes?
- Does the first AI draft sound usable enough for a manager to edit and send?
- Does Automation create useful lead timeline events without sending surprising duplicate replies?
- Are there any visible fallback/demo labels where the pilot expects real client context?
- Are any important manager actions still toast-only in the active pilot path?

## Pilot Cleanup

After repeated local pilot runs, inspect generated pilot records with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run db:cleanup:pilot
```

The cleanup utility is a dry-run by default. It only targets the seeded demo tenant and records with the `Pilot TG`, `Pilot Webhook`, `Pilot Widget`, and `Pilot Intake Workflow` prefixes.

Delete those prefixed pilot records only when you intentionally want to reset the local demo pilot data:

```bash
corepack pnpm run db:cleanup:pilot -- --confirm
```

## Current QA Coverage

Relevant smoke checks:

- `artifacts/playwright/social-intake-visibility.spec.ts`
- `artifacts/playwright/webhook-widget-intake-visibility.spec.ts`

- `artifacts/playwright/conversation-events-timeline.spec.ts`
- `artifacts/playwright/pipeline-actions.spec.ts`
- `artifacts/playwright/automation-api.spec.ts`
- `artifacts/playwright/analytics-api.spec.ts`

Run all focused product smokes with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run qa:api
```

Run the seeded local public-intake smoke with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run qa:pilot:intake
```

`qa:pilot:intake` requires the local API, database, and seeded demo public keys. It creates a temporary active workflow, posts Telegram/webhook/widget inbound messages, verifies Inbox, Pipeline, workflow timeline events, and manager follow-up, then archives the temporary workflow.

Run the optional public URL/tunnel smoke with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run qa:pilot:public
```

`qa:pilot:public` requires `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE` and `LEADVIRT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`. Without them it skips. With them it posts public Telegram, webhook, and widget traffic through the configured public API URL.
